# FLOWR: Flow Matching for Structure-Aware De Novo, Interaction- and Fragment-Based Ligand Generation

FLOWR is a research repository that investigates continuous and discrete flow matching methods applied to structure-based drug discovery. It provides a complete workflow for training models, generating novel ligand molecules, and evaluating the generated structures.

## Getting Started

We provide the full SPINDR data in both .smol and .cif format, as well as a fully trained FLOWR model checkpoint and generated samples.
For training, generation and evaluation, we provide basic bash and SLURM scripts in the `scripts/` directory. These scripts are intended to be modified and adjusted according to your computational resources and experimental needs.

### Data
Download the SPINDR dataset, the FLOWR checkpoint and generated samples here:
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/uploads/15212510)
To train a model, untar the smol_data.tar to get the smol-files. Specify the directory they are placed in the respective scripts (see below).
We also provide the cif-files for all protein pockets splitted into train, validation and test.
For running generation only, place the flowr.ckpt path somewhere and specify its location in the `scripts/gen_spindr.sl` script.

### Training the Model

Start by training the model using the provided training script. This script sets hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and network architecture.

Modify `scripts/train_spindr.sh` as needed, then run:

```bash
bash scripts/train_spindr.sh
```

### Generating Molecules

After training, generate novel molecules using the generation script. This script supports GPU execution and includes options such as sampling steps and noise injection.

Modify `scripts/gen_spindr.sl` according to your requirements, then submit the job via SLURM:

```bash
sbatch scripts/gen_spindr.sl
```

### Evaluating Molecules

Evaluate the generated molecules using the evaluation script. This step calculates metrics including molecular validity, uniqueness, and interaction recovery.

Modify `scripts/eval_spindr.sh` as needed, then run:

```bash
bash scripts/eval_spindr.sh
```
