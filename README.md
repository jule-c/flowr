# FLOWR: Flow Matching for Structure-Aware De Novo, Interaction- and Fragment-Based Ligand Generation
![FLOWR Overview](FLOWR.png)

FLOWR is a research repository that investigates continuous and discrete flow matching methods applied to structure-based drug discovery. It provides a complete workflow for training models, generating novel ligand molecules, and evaluating the generated structures.

## Installation

1. **Create the Environment**  
   Install the required environment using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io):

   ```bash
   mamba env create -f environment.yml
   ```

2. **Activate the Environment**  

   ```bash
   conda activate flowr
   ```

3. **Set PYTHONPATH**  
   Ensure the repository directory is in your Python path:

   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="$PWD"
   ```

4. **Install ADFR**
   Install the [ADFR suite](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/downloads/).
   Adjust the prepare_receptor_bin_path in genbench3d/configs/default.yaml to match the ADFR installation.

## Getting Started

We provide the full SPINDR data in both .smol and .cif format, as well as a fully trained FLOWR model checkpoint and generated samples.
For training, generation and evaluation, we provide basic bash and SLURM scripts in the `scripts/` directory. These scripts are intended to be modified and adjusted according to your computational resources and experimental needs.

### Data
Download the SPINDR dataset, the FLOWR checkpoint and generated samples here:
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15257565).

Download the genbench3d_data.tar and place it untarred in the repo (we will get rid of this dependency in the future).

To train a model, unzip the smol_data.zip to get the smol-files. Specify the directory they are placed in the respective scripts (see below).
We also provide the cif-files for all protein pockets splitted into train, validation and test.

Generation of novel molecules either de novo or fragment-based can be done with the provided checkpoint (flowr.ckpt).

### Training the Model

Start by training the model using the provided training script. This script sets hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and network architecture.

Modify `scripts/train_spindr.sh` as needed, then run:

```bash
bash scripts/train_spindr.sh
```

### Generating Molecules

After training (or with the provided flowr.ckpt), generate novel molecules using the provided generation script. 

Modify `scripts/gen_spindr.sl` according to your requirements, then submit the job via SLURM:

```bash
sbatch scripts/gen_spindr.sl
```

### Generating Molecules from PDB/CIF
After training (or with the provided flowr.ckpt), you can generate novel molecules given a PDB or CIF protein/pocket file.

If you provide a protein PDB/CIF file, you need to provide a ligand file as well to cut out the pocket (default: 6A cutoff - modify if needed).
Currently, Multimers are not supported. Please modify (single-chain) or cut the protein in advance.

Note, if you want to run conditional generation, you need to provide a ligand file as reference. 

Modify `scripts/gen_pdb.sl` according to your requirements, then submit the job via SLURM:

```bash
sbatch scripts/gen_pdb.sl
```

Generated ligands are saved as an SDF file at the specified location (save_dir).


### Evaluating Molecules

Evaluate the generated molecules using the evaluation script. This step calculates metrics including molecular validity, uniqueness, and interaction recovery.

Modify `scripts/eval_spindr.sh` as needed, then run:

```bash
bash scripts/eval_spindr.sh
```
